2009-06-21 Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETLayoutItem:
	(-didChangeLayout:): Modified to now update the layout view and the 
	scrollable area item visibility.
	* ETLayoutItem+Scrollable:
	(-updateScrollableAreaItemVisibility): Added.
	(-didChangeDecoratorOfItem:): Moved the receiver validity check into a new 
	assertion.
	* ETLayout:
	(-isScrollable, -hasScrollers): Added.
	* ETWidgetLayout: 
	(-hasScrollers): Added overriden method.
	* ETObjectBrowserLayout:
	(-hasScrollers): Added overriden method (temporary solution).
	* ETContainer:
	(-setTemporaryView:): Moved the code that controls the scrollable area 
	item visibility into -[ETLayoutItem(Scrollable) 
	updateScrollableAreaItemVisibility].
	
2009-06-12 Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETLayoutItem:
	Added _styleGroup ivar.
	(-styleGroup, -setStyleGroup:, -dealloc): Updated to use the new ivar.
	* ETStyle:
	Altered to inherit from NSObject and not from ETObjectChain. Removed ivar 
	_nextStyle. Rewritten or updated both class and method documentation.
	(-initWithStyle:, -initWithCollection:, -nextStyle, -setNextStyle:, -lastStyle): 
	Removed.
	(-render:layoutItem:dirtyRect:, -didChangeItemBounds:): Modified to do 
	nothing now.
	* ETStyleGroup:
	Improved documentation.

2009-06-11 Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETLayoutItem:
	Added kETStyleGroupProperty property and removed kETStyleProperty.
	(-styleGroup, -setStyleGroup:): Added.
	(-style, setStyle:): Rewritten to use -styleGroup and be syntatic sugar to 
	access the first style.
	(-initWithView:value:representedObject:, -dealloc, -copyWithZone:, 
	-properties): Updated.
	* ETHandle:
	(-[ETHandleGroup initWithActionHandler:manipulatedObject:]): Modified to 
	suppress ETBasicItemStyle instance which is set by ETLayoutItem.
	(-[ETResizeRectangle style]): Removed.
	(-[ETResizeRectangle render:dirtyRect:inView:): Renamed 
	-render:layoutItem:dirtyRect:, this way we now override the ETLayoutItem 
	main render method and the overriden -style can be removed.
	* ETPickDropCoordinator:
	(-draggingExited:): Fixed crash on inserting a nil drop indicator in 
	-insertDropIndicator:forDropTarget:. Assigning _previousDropTarget without 
	-updateDropIndicator:withDropTarget: was messing up the internal state. 
	Now we can be sure _previousDropTarget always has a valid drop indicator 
	set, and thereby no nil drop indicator will ever be inserted on a dragging 
	update.
	(-dropIndicatorForDropTarget:, -insertDropIndicator:forDropTarget:, 
	-removeDropIndicatorForDropTarget:): Rewritten to use the style group 
	facility and get rid of the previous hack that involved to copy the 
	existing item style before inserting the drop indicator.
	
2009-06-09 Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	First step in making the styling support really usable and clean.
	The current version implements styles as linked list which can bound to a 
	layout	item with -setStyle:. However this doesn't work well because styles 
	tend to be shared and you get in trouble when you want to chain new styles 
	without altering all the items which share the existing style. 
	e.g. when the pick and drop coordinator tries to insert the drop indicator 
	style as the last style on a drop target, the drop indicator gets drawn on 
	every layouts items since they all use the same instance of ETBasicItemStyle as 
	their default style. The current workaround is to do roughly:
	[[item style] setStyle: [[item style] copy]]
	[[item lastStyle] setNextStyle: dropIndicator]
	* ETStyleGroup.(h|m):
	Added.
	* EtoileUI.h, GNUmakefile, Source/GNUmakefile:
	Updated.

2009-06-05 Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETUIItem.(h|m):
	Added.
	* ETDecoratorItem.(h|m):
	Extracted ETUIItem into the new header and source files mentionned just 
	above.
	* EtoileUI.h:
	Included both ETUIItem.h and ETDecoratorItem.h. The latter was previously 
	missing. 
	* GNUmakefile, Source/GNUmakefile:
	Updated.

2009-06-05 Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETUIItem (in ETDecoratorItem.(h|m)):
	(-isDecoratorItem, -isWindowItem, -enclosingItem, 
	-convertRectToEnclosingItem:, -convertPointToEnclosingItem:): Added.
	* ETCompatibility.h:
	Added ASSERT_FAIL and ASSERT_INVALID_CASE utility macros.

2009-06-03 Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	Introduced ETUIItemFactory which takes over ETLayoutItem+Factory, this 
	category is going to be deprecated in a next commit.
	* ETUIItemFactory:
	Refactored ETLayoutItem+Factory in a standalone factory and cleaned the API.
	Updated many method documentation and documented some methods which weren't. 	
	All class methods are now instance methods of the factory. 
	(+factory): Added.
	(+itemGroupWithView:, +itemGroupWithValue:, +floatingItemGroup): Eliminated 
	these methods declared in ETLayoutItem+Factory which have never found any 
	real use.
	* GNUmakefile, Source/GNUmakefile, EtoileUI.h:
	Updated.

2009-05-25 Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETEvent:
	(-locationInWindowItem, -locationInWindowContentItem):
	Rewritten to return the event location in window base coordinates with 
	-locationInWindowItem and not -locationInWindowContentItem as wrongly 
	implemented previously. The previous implementation happens to work 
	correctly on Mac OS X, because the bottom border is zero pixel thick and 
	the window base coordinates are not flipped. I wrongly assumed that 
	the window coordinate base was the content view coordinate space (except it 
	was always non-flipped) when I initially wrote the code...
	Now -locationInWindowContentItem depends on -locationInWindowItem as it 
	should and not the reverse as before.
	(-location): Fixed to handle the case where the window layer uses flipped 
	coordinates. In fact, that's the default case with EtoileUI.
	* ETInstrument:
	(-hitTestWithEvent:): Improved to intercept and handle window layer 
	related events correctly. Renamed contentViewRelativePoint variable to 
	windowItemRelativePoint since that's now the case and removed the 
	warning comment, which doesn't hold anymore thanks to ETEvent whose 
	location-related methods are now sensible and consistent.
	* test_ETInstrument.m: Updated, cleaned and improved the event handling 
	tests.

2009-05-14 Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	New event handling model - part 4
	Snapshot of my current massive rewrite of EtoileUI event model.
	This introduces a new event handling model based on instrument/tool concept.
	Instruments/tools encapsulate the event handling logic and make it reusable,
	they convert events into semantic actions and send these to layout items
	(rather than events as other UI toolkits do).
	Among the major new features are several tools (move, select, arrow, paint
	bucket) which hands actions to the action handler bound to the layout item on
	which the instrument/tool is acting upon. And many new DTP-like additions
	such handles, grouping/ungrouping, rubber banding, z-index reordering etc.
	This commit includes more or less unrelated changes such as several new layouts
	template item layout, icon layout, form layout and various cleaned/rewritten
	elements such as window item,  window layout, AppKit to EUI layout item
	builder, free layout etc. In addition, geometry and drawing fixes are bundled
	with this elephant-style commit... not pretty, but let say that the hackathon
	is a good excuse to do that!
	PhotoViewExample has also been almost entirely rewritten to conform to the
	latest EtoileUI API trends :-) Few other examples remain to be updated.

2009-04-16 Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETDecoratorItem:
	(-decorationRect): Fixed to behave correctly when the next decorator uses no 
	supervisor view.
	(-decorationSizeForContentSize:): Added.
	(-decoratedItemRectChanged:): Updated to use the previous method and call 
	-handleSetDecorationRect: now with the correct value.
	* ETLayoutItem:
	(-contentBounds): Reverted my previous change on -contentBounds which was 
	incorrect. 
	(-setContentBounds:): Modified to support to sync _contentBounds when the  
	supervisor view frame is altered even when the receiver has a  decorator. 
	Previously -contentBounds value was invalid when the receiver had been 
	resized through its supervisor view itself resized by an enclosing 
	decorator (such as an ETWindowItem).
	* ETScrollableAreaItem:
	Fixed to have an underlying scroll view created at initialization.
	(-init): Modified to call -initWithSupervisorView:.
	(-initWithSupervisorView:): Added.
	Tweaked ETScrollView to create an NSScrollView automatically when a nil 
	scroll view is passed to -initWithScrollView:layoutItem:.
	* ETWindowItem:
	(-handleDecorateItem:supervisorView:inView:): Modified to shrink the 
	content size and match the window frame with the decorated item one.
	* ETView:
	(-setFrame:, -setFrameSize:, -setFrameOrigin:): Modified to sync the 
	geometry even when a decorator is used on -layoutItem.
	* test_ETLayoutItem.m:
	Broken decorator geometry related into several methods. Updated various 
	tests and written -testTooManyDecoratorGeometry to test a window/scroll 
	decorator combo.

2009-04-13 Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	Moved syntactic sugar related to scrollers from ETContainer to a new
	category ETLayoutItem+Scrollable. This works in tandem with 
	ETScrollableAreaItem decorator which wraps an underlying scroll view.
	The cleaning of this code is not yet finished.
	* GNUmakefile: 
	* Source/GNUmakefile:
	Included ETLayoutItem+Scrollable.[h|m]
	* Headers/EtoileUI.h: Included ETLayoutItem+Scrollable.h
	* ETContainer:
	Removed ivars _scrollViewDecorator and _scrollViewShown.
	(-letsLayoutControlsScrollerVisibility, 
	-setLetsLayoutControlsScrollerVisibility:, -hasVerticalScroller, 
	-setHasVerticalScroller:, -hasHorizontalScroller, -setHasHorizontalScroller:
	-scrollView, -isScrollViewShown): Deprecated and moved to 
	ETLayoutItem+Scrollable.
	(-cacheScrollViewDecoratorItem:, -cachedScrollViewDecoratorItem, 
	-createScrollViewDecoratorItem, -setShowsScrollView:, 
	-didChangeDecoratorOfItem:): Moved to ETLayoutItem+Scrollable.
	(-setLayoutView:, -setFrame:, -setFrameSize:): Updated to call the previous 
	methods on -layoutItem.
	* ETView:
	(-didChangeDecoratorOfItem:): Removed
	* ETUIItem (in ETDecoratorItem.[h|m]):
	(-didChangeDecoratorOfItem:): Added.
	* ETLayout, ETWidgetLayout:
	(-isWidget): Added.
	* ETLayoutItem:
	Added _scrollViewShown ivar. Removed _action, _target that were forgotten 
	here in a today commit, and also _reserved.
	(-action): Corrected to return the action property stored in the 
	property dictionary.
	* ETLayoutItemGroup:
	Removed -isScrollViewShown implementation now handled by 
	ETLayoutItem+Scrollable.
	* ETLayoutItem+Scrollable:
	Added.

2009-04-13 Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	Moved target/action support from ETContainer to ETLayoutItem and 
	ETLayoutItemGroup. 
	Moved various ETContainer private methods to ETWidgetLayout, that are used 
	to synchronize the settings of widgets-based layouts with their layout 
	context. Synchronized properties include scroller visibility, target/action 
	etc.
	* ETLayoutItem:
	New 'target' and 'action' properties and related accessors.
	(-properties): Updated.
	* ETLayoutItemGroup:
	New 'doubleAction' property and related accessors.
	(-properties): Updated.
	* ETContainer:
	Removed ivars _doubleClickAction, _target, _doubleClickedItem, 
	_multipleSelectionAllowed and _emptySelectionAllowed.
	(-doubleAction, -setDoubleAction:, -target, -setTarget:, 
	-doubleClickedItem): Deprecated and moved these methods into ETLayoutItem 
	and ETLayoutItemGroup.
	(-allowsMultipleSelection, -setAllowsMultipleSelection:, 
	-allowsEmptySelection, -setAllowsEmptySelection:): Deprecated. To be 
	replaced later by the upcoming ETSelectTool (part of the new event handling 
	model). In the meantime, these properties will implicitly always be equal to 
	YES.
	(-syncDisplayViewWithContainer:): Moved code into -[ETWidgetLayout 
	syncLayoutViewWithItem:] and modified simply to call this method now.
	(-invocationForSelector:, -sendInvocationToDisplayView:, 
	-layoutViewWithoutScrollView): Moved to ETWidgetLayout.
	(-forwardDoubleActionFromLayout:): Moved to ETWidgetLayout under the 
	name -doubleClick:.
	* ETContainer+EventHandling:
	(-mouseDown:): Updated to call -mouseDoubleClickItem.
	(-mouseDoubleClickItem:): Renamed -mouseDoubleClick:item: and modified to 
	take in account 'doubleClickedItem' is now declared on ETLayoutItemGroup.
	* ETLayout:
	(-syncLayoutViewWithItem:): New abstract method.
	* ETWidgetLayout:
	(-syncLayoutViewWithItem:, -invocationForSelector:, 
	-sendInvocationToDisplayView:, -layoutViewWithoutScrollView, 
	-doubleClick:, -doubleClickedItem): Added.
	* ETBrowserLayout:
	(-doubleClick:): Updated to call the superclass implementation inherited 
	from ETWidgetLayout.

2009-04-07 Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	Finished to rework the geometry model to be consistent and better support
	clipped content (e.g. when the content is scrollable). Now the frame is an
	implicit property computed on demand (as CoreAnimation does it). The API 
	hasn't really changed though and this shouldn't impact existing applications.
	* Container.xcodeproj: Updated.
	* ETLayoutItem, ETLayoutItemGroup:
	Reworked and finished the new geometry model. Many methods touched.
	Extracted the decorator support in a new class ETDecoratorItem and 
	introduced acommon class ETUIItem which factors code shared by ETLayouItem 
	and ETDecoratorItem. 
	* ETDecoratorItem:
	* ETScrollableAreaItem:
	Rewritten decorator related code almost entirely to use the new geometry 
	model.
	The decorator API is now easier to understand and cleaner.
	Renamed and rewritten -convertDisplayRect:toAncestorDisplayView: that 
	handles how damaged areas are propagated back to the views in charge of the 
	display. This method is now written in a recursive style to make the code 
	less complex and support to invalid areas on decorators (not yet used though).
	* ETWindowItem:
	Rewritten.
	* ETLayer.m:
	* ELLayoutItemBuilder:
	Fixed to create window items correctly.
	* ETView:
	Moved ETScrollView to ETScrollableAreaItem.
	Overriden frame related setters to notify the layout item about geometry 
	changes.
	* ETContainer: 
	Updated to use the right ETDecoratorItem type when needed.
	* test_ETLayoutItem:
	Updated to match new behaviors. Added some new geometry tests.

2009-03-18  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETLayoutItem:
	(-setView:): Removed the code that checks whether the new view should be 
	set as a supervisor view or not.
	* ETView:
	(-initWithFrame:layoutItem:): Updated to use -setSupervisorView: through 
	-setLayoutItem: since -initWithView: won't work now to set a supervisor 
	view.
	(-setLayoutItem:): Updated to use -setSupervisorView: as needed.
	* test_ETLayoutItem, test_ETView:
	Updated all tests that which were using -setView: or -initWithView: to 
	set a supervisor view.

2009-03-17  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETLayoutItem:
	(-view): Simplified -[ETLayoutItem view] to never return the supervisor view 
	itself but only its wrapped view.
	-(beginEditingUI): Updated to use -supervisorView.
	* ETLayoutItemGroup
	(-isContainer, -handleAttachViewOfItem:, -setVisibleItems:forItems:, 
	-itemScaleFactor, -visibleContentSize, -isScrollViewShown, -setContentSize:):
	 Updated to use -supervisorView.
	* ETLayoutItemGroup+Mutation:
	(-container): Updated to use -supervisorView.
	* ETLayout:
	Replaced -view by -supervisorView in ETLayoutingContext protocol.
	(-container): Updated to use -supervisorView.
	* test_ETLayoutItem, test_ETLayoutItemBuilder, test_ETView: 
	Updated to use -view and -supervisorView as expected.	

2009-03-09  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	Implemented sorting and searching in the layout item tree. The controller 
	layer is now mostly finished. This code remains to be tested.
	* ETController:
	New ivars _sortDescriptors, _filterPredicate, 
	_automaticallyRearranges, _hasNewSortDescriptors, _hasNewFilterPredicate, 
	_hasNewContent.
	(-init, -dealloc-: Updated.
	(-filterPredicate, -setFilterPredicate:, -automaticallyRearrangesObjects:, 
	-setAutomaticallyRearrangesObjects:): Added.
	* ETLayoutItemGroup:
	(+isAutolayoutEnabled, +enablesAutolayout, +disablesAutolayout): Added.
	Will probbly related instance methods in the long run.
	(-dealloc): Updated.
	(-properties): Removed 'layout' declaration now declared at ETLayoutItem 
	level.
	(-sortWithSortDescriptors:recursively:, -filterWithPredicate:recursively:, 
	-arrangedItems, -isSorted, -isFiltered): Added. These methods are used by 
	ETController.
	(-setSelectionIndexPaths:): Extracted some code into -didChangeSelection: 
	that lets external objects trigger selection notifications.
	(-didChangeSelection:): Added.

2009-03-08  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	New event handling model - part 3
	* ETLayoutItem
	New boundingBox and layout property. Added _boundingBox ivar.
	(-init): Updated to initialize boundingBox and have -setFlipped: alters the 
	supervisor view equivalent property as it should.
	(-usesWidgetView, -layout, -setLayout:, -setNeedsDisplayInRect:, 
	-displayRect:, -boundingBox, -setBoundingBox:): Added.
	(-properties): Updated to expose boundingBox, layout and autoresizingMask.
	(-setNeedsDisplay:): Moved the existing code into -setNeedsDisplayInRect:.
	(-display): Moved the existing code into -displayRect:.
	(-convertDisplayRect:toAncestorDisplayView:): Fixed to take in account 
	the case where the display view is NSThemeFrame and the content view must 
	be rather returned.
	(-respondsToSelector:, -methodSignatureForSelector:, -forwardInvocation:): 
	New methods to support the EtoileUI custom responder chain and to hand 
	actions to the action handler.
	* NSView+Etoile, Controls+Etoile:
	(-isWidget): Added.

2009-03-07  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETFreeLayout:
	Corrected header import statements to be local.
	(-loadPersistentFramesForItems:): Improved to check unitialized persistent 
	frame properly and documented.
	(-resetItemPersistentFramesWithLayout:): Renamed 
	-resetItemLocationsWithLayout: and rewrote it to eliminate dependency on 
	ETContainer and works with invisible items too. Documented too.

2009-03-06  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETLayoutItem:
	(-convertDisplayRect:toAncestorDisplayView:): Fixed an infinite loop issue 
	that occurs when trying to redisplay a rect which extends beyond the 
	boundaries of the topmost ancestor display view.
	(-setImage:): Modified to update the default frame with the image size, 
	otherwise the default frame is zero and any scaling done at layout time
	will always result in a negative size.
	* ETLayout:
	(-resizeLayoutItems:toScaleFactor:): Enabled scaling in all cases, now that 
	we can support it on layout items without a view.
	* ETLayoutItemGroup:
	(-display:item:dirtyRect:inView:): Fixed coordinate matrix corruption which 
	happens when -[ETLayout rootItem] returning a nil item in the calling 
	method.
	(-updateLayout:): Cleaned and documented.
	* ETStyle: 
	(-drawImage:flipped:inRect:): Fixed to work more or less on GNUstep by 
	using a flip transform. But... NSImage doesn't seem to always draw 
	themselves properly on GNUstep when the context uses flipped coordinates. 
	The new code also allows to safely draw cached images on Cocoa 
	(-[NSImage setFlipped:] isn't reliable in that case).

2009-03-05  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* Collage:
	Added a preliminary structured graphics editor example.

2009-02-17  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETLayoutItem:
	(-initWithView:value:representedObject:): Turned flipped coordinates on by 
	default.
	(-setSupervisorView:): Modified to sync the new supervisor view with the 
	flipped property of the layout item.
	(-setFrame:): Modified to notify the style object about bounds change.

2009-02-15  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETView:
	(-release): Rewritten retain cycle management code/doc a bit to be easier to 
	understand.
	(-_recursiveDisplayAllDirtyWithLockFocus:visRect:): Modified to mark 
	_wasJustRedrawn.
	(_recursiveDisplayRectIfNeededIgnoringOpacity:isVisibleRect:rectIsVisibleRectForView:):
	Added to truly redraw properly on Mac OS X in all cases.
	(-[ETScrollView initWithFrame:layoutItem:]): Modified to use no scrollers 
	by default, otherwise -[ETContainer hasVerticalScroller] wrongly starts to 
	return YES once the layout is switched, because -setLayoutView: causes the 
	scroll view decorator to be created like that:
	-[ETContainer createScrollViewDecoratorItem]
	-[ETContainer scrollView]
	-[ETContainer hasVerticalScroller]
	-[ETContainer syncDisplayViewWithContainer]
	-[ETContainer setLayoutView:]
	* ETContainer:
	(-setHasVerticalScroller:, -setHasHorizontalScoller:): Imrproved to only 
	insert the scroll view decorator when a scroller becomes a visible.
	(-createScrollViewDecoratorItem): Added an assertion to check the scroller 
	visibility meet our expectations.

2009-02-14  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETStyle:
	(-[ETStyle didChangeItemBounds:]): Added.
	ETBasicItemStyle
	(-render:layoutItem:dirtyRect:): Updated.
	(-drawImage:flipped:inRect:): Modified to draw properly even if the item is 
	flipped.
	(-drawStackIndicatorInRect:): Added.

2009-01-30  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETLayoutItemGroup:
	(-render:dirtyRect:inView:): Modified to draw the layout item tree 
	encapsulated in the layout, this way we can really support arbitrary UI 
	composition.
	(-display:item:dirtyRect:inView:): Fixed to check the flipping correctly. 
	(-unmakeGroup): Rewritten to be usable.

2009-01-30  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETLayoutItemGroup:
	For clarity, splitted the index and path based informal source protocol into 
	two distinct protocols.
	(-itemsWithSubviewsOfView:): Moved to ETLayoutItemBuilder.
	(-handleAttachViewOfItem:, -handleDetachViewOfItem:, -handleAttachItem:, 
	-handleDetachItem:): Improved the documentation and tidied the code a bit.
	Improved and reformatted the documentation of methods related to the 
	represented object or source object.
	* ETLayoutItemBuilder:
	(-renderView:): Improved to set the persistent frame on each built item. 
	Thereby the existing view frames are never lost when we set a layout 
	(by default the layout of each built item group is nil here).

2009-01-30  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETLayer:
	Added an experimental ETWindowLayout with the possibility to switch the 
	layout of the window layer from a WM-based layout to a layout such as 
	outline, table, flow etc.
	ETWindowLayer
	Added _visibleWindows and _rootWindow ivar.
	(-init, -dealloc): Updated.
	(-_createRetainedRootWindow, -hideHardWindows, -showHardWindows): Added.
	(-setLayout:): Overriden to use the previous two methods.
	
2009-01-29  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETLayout:
	(-setLayoutContext:): Documented new display view removal code in details.
	(-render:isNewContent): Moved layout context check to -canRender. Moved 
	code incorrectly disabled that removes display views to -setLayoutContext:.

2009-01-28  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETContainer:
	Removed ETContainerSelectionDidChangeNotification.
	* ETLayoutItemGroup:
	Added ETItemGroupSelectionDidChangeNotification. Updated and reformatted 
	selection related method documentation. Removed some unecessary extra tabs 
	in the methods.
	(-setSelectionIndexPaths:): Updated to send the new notification to the 
	delegate.
	* ETPaneLayout, ETPaneSwitcherLayout, ETInspector, ETTableLayout:  Updated 
	to use the new notification.

2009-01-28  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETTableLayout:
	Rewritten a bit various methods to be shorter by using more syntatic sugar.
	(-setLayoutView:): Modified to use FOREACH, A, ETLayoutItemPboardType 
	constant and -tableView.
	(-setDisplayedProperties:, -selectedItems): Modified to use FOREACH.

2009-01-28  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETPickboard:
	Corrected header import statements and removed extra tab or unecessary 
	spacing in various methods.
	(-layoutItemWithObject:): Rewritten with FOREACH and documented.
	(-[ETPickCollection initWithCollection:]): Rewritten with SUPERINIT.

2009-01-27  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETLayoutItemGroup:
	(-displayedItemPropertiesInItemGroup:): Added. Moved ETContainer equivalent 
	declaration to ETLayoutItemGroup source protocol.
	* ETContainer:
	(-displayedItemPropertiesInContainer:): Removed.
	* ETInspector, ETViewModelLayout, ETTableLayout, ETObjectBrowserLayout, 
	ObjectManagerExample, PhotoViewExample:
	Updated to use the new method.

2009-01-27  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETLayoutItemGroup:
	Moved ETContainer index path-based source protocol to ETLayoutItemGroup, in 
	that way it is centered around the base item.
	(-itemGroup:numberOfItemsAtPath:, itemGroup:itemAtPath:): Added.
	* ETContainer:
	(-numberOfItemsInContainer:, container:itemAtIndex:):
	(-container:numberOfItemsAtPath::, container:itemAtPath:):
	Removed.
	* ETLayoutItemGroup+Mutation, ETInspector, ETBrowserLayout, 
	ETObjectBrowserLayout, ObjectManagerExample:
	Updated to use the new index path-based source protocol.

2009-01-27  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETLayoutItemGroup:
	Moved ETContainer index-based source protocol to ETLayoutItemGroup, in that 
	way it is centered around the base item.
	(-numberOfItemsInItemGroup:, itemGroup:itemAtIndex:): Added.
	* ETContainer:
	(-numberOfItemsInContainer:, container:itemAtIndex:): Deprecated
	* ETLayoutItemGroup+Mutation, ETViewModelLayout, ObjectManagerExample, 
	  PhotoViewExample, PaneExample:
	Updated to use the new index-based source protocol.
	Also improved PhotoViewExample to take in account composite layout when the 
	positional constraints are altered.

2009-01-27  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETLayoutItemGroup:
	(-source):
	(-setSource:):
	New methods moved out of ETContainer.
	* ETContainer:
	Removed _dataSource ivar (now declared as a property on ETLayoutItemGroup).
	(-source, -setSource:): Deprecated.

2009-01-26  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETLayoutItem:
	Added kETRepresentedPathProperty. Moved property access macros to 
	ETCompatibility.h
	(-representedPathBase): Modified to return the property rather than nil 
	by default.
	* ETLayoutItemGroup:
	(-representedPathBase): Removed this overriden method version.
	(-setRepresentedPathBase:): New method based on the old 
	-[ETContainer representedPath].
	* ETContainer:
	Removed _path ivar (now declared as a property on ETLayoutItem).
	(-representedPath, -setRepresentedPath:): Deprecated.

2009-01-24  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETContainer (-dealloc): Fixed a nasty double release error by removing 
	DESTROY(_layoutView). This ivar is weak reference, hence this line results 
	in an extra release that translates in more or less random crashes when a 
	view-based layout is released. Here is the sequence that leads to the crash:
	- an item group is deallocated and it releases its layout
	- the layout is deallocated and releases its layout view	
	At this point the layout view is still retained by the container as a subview
	... but later:
	- the container is deallocated and wrongly releases its layout view (which 
	was not retained in -setLayoutView:)
	- the layout view is deallocated
	- the container deallocation code terminates with [super dealloc] which 
	tries to release its subviews and thereby crashes when trying to send 
	-removeFromSuperview to the deallocated layout view.
	The crash happens very often on a window close which releases the layout 
	item tree it decorates. This fix should also solve random crashes that were 
	reported when the application terminates (and closes its windows).
	
2009-01-19  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETViewModelLayout:
	Corrected header import statements.
	New ivar _shouldInspectRepresentedObjectAsView. Documented API.
	(-awakeFromNib): Replaced the table layout by an outline one. Improved the 
	the column header readability and look by providing property display names. 
	Increased how much content can be viewed without scrolling or resizing by 
	setting the property view content font size to small.
	(-shouldInspectRepresentedObjectAsView, 
	-setShouldInspectRepresentedObjectAsView:, -inspectedItem): Added.
	Added a category to ETInstanceVariable to make each ivar object traversable 
	by explosing it as a collection of ivars if the ivar value is an object.
	(-doubleClickInPropertyView:): Rewritten to use -explore:.
	(-setLayoutContext:): Removed.
	(-object:itemRepresentingSlotAtIndex:, -numberOfSlotsInObject:): Rewritten 
	to better leverage EtoileFoundation reflection layer. Temporarily disabled 
	the listing of methods.
	(-numberOfItemsInContainer:): Tweaked to make use of 
	-shouldInspectRepresentedObjectAsView.
	* NSObject+EtoileUI: 
	Added -explore: to inspect objects with developer-centric inspector based 
	on ETViewModelLayout. Still a bit rough...

2009-01-19  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETLayoutItem+Factory:
	Corrected header import statements.
	(+itemGroupWithRepresentedObject:): Added.
	(+itemGroupWithContainer): Added a temporary hack to make autoresizing work.
	(+itemWithBezierPath:, +rectangleWithRect:, +rectangle, +ovalWithRect:, 
	+oval): Added various shape-based item factory methods.

2009-01-19  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* Headers/ETShape.h:
	* Source/ETShape.m:
	Removed previous code and added new class ETShape.

2009-01-19  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	Rewritten the basic inspector support to be entirely handled outside of 
	ETContainer.
	* ETContainer:
	Corrected EtoileUI header import statements to be local.
	Removed _inspector ivar and related code in -initWithFrame:layoutItem: and 
	-dealloc.

	NSObject+EtoileUI and ETLayoutItem.
	(-setInspector:, -inspector, -inspectorForItems:): Removed.
	* ETLayoutItem:
	New property kETInspectorProperty.

	handling model.
	(-showInspectorPanel): Removed.
	(-inspector): Rewritten.
	(-setInspector:): Added.
	* NSObject+EtoileUI (-inspect:): Modified to use the inspector provided by 
	the receiver when a custom one is available.

	inspectedObjects.
	* ETInspector: Removed the deprecated inspectedItems accessors.

2009-01-18  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETApplication (-finishLaunching): Fixed the missing title of the 
	application menu on GNUstep and the repeated logging of 'Services menu not 
	in main menu!'. This bug was recently introduced with r4188.

2009-01-09  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	Optimized drawing to only redraw dirty portion of the layout item tree. 
	More documentation. 
	Few new utility methods related to the drawing or the geometry.
	* ETLayoutItem:
	Documented various methods.
	(-initWithView:value:representedObject:): Modified to set a default frame 
	if no view is provided.
	(-isBaseItem, -closestAncestorItemWithDisplayView, 
	-convertDisplayRect:toAncestorDisplayView:, -boundingBox, 
	-convertRectToParent:fromItem:, -convertRect:toItem:, -acceptsActions): 
	Added.
	(-setSelected:): Made KVO compliant.
	(-setNeedsDisplay:, -display): Rewritten to only trigger the redraw of the 
	receiver area in the view hierarchy. The dirty rect is computed with 
	-convertDisplayRect:toAncestorDisplayView:.

2008-12-30  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	Extended ETApplication with a new Arrange built-in menu and the possibility 
	to instantiate a main controller specified in the info plist of the 
	application bundle.
	Corrected header import statements.
	* ETApplication:
	Added ETApp macro. Documented the class a bit more. New enum for menu item
	tags.
	(-finishLaunching): Reworked to set up the menu bar as soon as possible.
	(-_instantiateAppDelegateIfSpecified): Added.
	(-developmentMenuItem:): Updated to use +menuItemWithTitle:tag:action: 
	category and ETDevelopmentMenuTag.
	(-arrangeMenuItem): Added.
	(+[NSMenuItem(Etoile) menuItemWithTitle:tag:action:]): Added.

2008-12-26  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	Some work to clean and improve the geometry support.
	* ETLayoutItem:
	Removed _defaultFrame ivar. Declared kETDefaultFrameProperty, 
	kETFlippedProperty, kETAnchorPointProperty and kETNeedsDisplay. Added 
	HAS_PROPERTY macro.
	(-display, -bounds, -centeredAnchorPoint, -anchorPoint, -setAnchorPoint:
	-position, -setPosition:): Added.
	(-setFlipped:): Modified to adjust the anchor point if needed.
	(-isFlipped): Added a check to ensure -isFlipped is consistent between 
	the supervisor view and the item.
	(-defaultFrame, -setDefaultFrame:): Modified to store its value in the 
	variable properties and returns a null rect by default.

2008-12-15  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	New event handling model - part 2
	Added an ETActionHandler skeleton that will replace the event handler 
	logic located in ETLayoutItem+Events.
	Added new geometry methods to ETLayoutItem that will be used to dispatch 
	events in the layout item tree.
	* ETLayoutItem:
	(-eventHandler): Deprecated.
	(-actionHandler, -setActionHandler): Added. Thought to replace -eventHandler.
	(-convertRectToParent:, -convertRectFromParent:): Rewritten to work properly.
	(-convertPointToParent:, -convertPointFromParent:, -containsPoint:, 
	-pointInside:, -isFlipped): Added.
	(-copyWithZone:, -dealloc): Updated to take in account the action handler.
	(-init): Ditto. Also modified to initialize the property dictionary
	immediately rather than lazily in -variableProperties.
	* ETLayoutItem+Events:
	Added an ETActionHandler skeleton.
	
2008-12-12  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	Turned ETContainer(ETController) into a standalone ETController class.
	* ETContainer:
	Moved _objectClass, _groupClass, _templateItem and _templateItemGroup ivars 
	to ETController.
	* ETController:
	Added _content ivar.
	(-init, -dealloc, -setContent:, -selectionIndex, -setSelectionIndex:, 
	-selectionIndexes, -setSelectionIndexes:): Added.
	(-content): Modified to return the ivar value now.
	(-newObject, -newGroup): Modified to use the new content property.
	* ETLayoutItemGroup.m:
	(-newItem, -newItemGroup, itemWithObject:isValue:): Moved to 
	ETLayoutItemGroup+Mutation category.
	* ETLayoutItemGroup+Mutation:
	Declared kETControllerProperty.
	* test_ETController.m: Updated.

2008-12-08  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	New event handling model - part 1
	* ETEvent:
	Rewritten ETEvent to be a standalone event class that wraps backend events 
	rather than an NSEvent subclass. NSEvent initializers don't expose all 
	the initialization, so the subclass choice was troublesome.
	* ETLayoutItem+Events (-beginDrag:forItem:image:layout:): Updated to pass a 
	backend event to an AppKit drag related method.

2008-09-04  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETLayout 
	New work-in-progress protocols ETPositionalLayout and ETCompositeLayout.
	(-isComposite): Added.
	(-resizeLayoutItems:toScaleFactor:, -setItemSizeConstraintStyle:): 
	Documented.
	(-render:isNewContent:): Commented out the call to -setVisibleItems:, so the 
	visibility of the items is only handled in 
	-renderWithLayoutItems:isNewContent:.

2008-09-04  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETLayout (-resizeLayoutItems:toScaleFactor:): Applied item size contraint 
	only if requested, when -itemSizeConstraintStyle returns another value than 
	ETSizeConstraintStyleNone. This fixes the case where a zero size is 
	returned by -constrainedItemSize and wrongly applied with the scaling.

2008-09-03  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	Extracted -[ETBasicItemStyle render:layoutItem:dirtyRect:] into two new 
	methods. Enhanced existing code to draw a way more pretty selection 
	indicator (light gray interior, dark gray border), instead of the boring 
	blue square that was playing this role until then.
	* ETStyle.[hm]:
	(-[ETBasicItemStyle render:layoutItem:dirtyRect:]): Modularized the drawing 
	code into two new methods.
	(-[ETBasicItemStyle drawImage:]):
	(-[ETBasicItemStyle drawSelectionIndicatorInRect:]):
	Added.

2008-09-03  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	Made possible to create application without nibs on Mac OS X, by writing 
	the code that builds and installs the main menu. This will make the 
	maintenance of EtoileUI examples less a burden, no nibs and gorms to 
	keep in sync.
	* ETApplication
	More documentation.
	(-_buildMainMenuIfNeeded, -_createApplicationMenu): New methods.
	(-finishLaunching): Updated to call -_buildMainMenuIfNeeded.

2008-08-31  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETLayout 
	(-tearDown, -selectionDidChangeInLayoutContext): New methods.
	(-setLayoutContext:): Modified to call -tearDown if needed.
	* ETLayoutItemGroup (-setLayout:): Cleansed. Moved layout view removal code
	to -[ETLayout tearDown] since the layout is responsible of the layout view.
	
2008-08-31  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETLayout
	(-render:isNewContent:): Cleaned. Extracted the code that sets the initial 
	layout size into a new method -resetLayoutSize.
	(-canRender, -resetLayoutSize): Added.
	(-renderWithLayoutItems:isNewContent:): Moved up the item scaling call 
	from ETComputedLayout, and added a call to -resetLayoutSize so that the 
	initial layout is now set here instead of -render:isNewContent:.
	* ETComputedLayout (-renderWithLayoutItems:isNewContent:): Moved the item 
	scaling back into ETLayout, so that it can be shared with other subclasses.
	* ETFreeLayout: Fixed two compilation warnings (temporary fix).

2008-08-31  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETLayout, ETComputedLayout:
	(-layoutLineForLayoutItems:, -layoutModelForLayoutItems:, 
	-computeLayoutItemLocationsForLayoutModel:): Moved down to ETComputedLayout 
	subclass from ETLayout.
	(-renderWithLayoutItems:isNewContent:): Moved implementation down to 
	ETComputedLayout.
	* ETPaneLayout, ETPaneSwitcherLayout: Updated to get rid of the compilation
	warnings triggered by these changes. Temporary fix until these classes are
	rewritten.

2008-08-28  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETLayout (-resizeItems:toScaleFactor:): Fixed by removing an unwanted bit 
	of code, the items should now be scaled even when no item size constraint is 
	set.
	
	* ETFlowLayout, ETLineLayout, ETStackLayout: 
	Defined subclass relative default values for item margin, item size 
	constraint and item constrained size. May need to be tweaked to be really 
	sensible.

2008-08-28  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	Implemented item margin for flow, line and stack layouts. A big step for a
	real photo view and an incremental step towards form layout :-)
	Added a new abstract class ETComputedLayout, that will be useful to extract 
	state and behavior ETLayout.

	* ETLayout: 
	Declared protocol ETPositionalLayout.
	(-isPositional): Added.
	(-isComputedLayout): Modified to return NO and updated the doc.
	
	* ETFlowLayout, ETStackLayout:
	Modified to inherit from ETComputedLayout and modified the layout 
	rendering methods to take in account the item margin.
	
	* ETComputedLayout.[hm]: Added.
	* EtoileUI.h: Included ETComputedLayout.h.
	* Container.xcodeproj, GNUmakefile: Updated.
	* PhotoViewExample: Added a slider to control the item margin. Only modified 
	the nib but not the gorm file yet.

2008-08-25  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	Modularized the drawing of the layout items, the default rendering style 
	is now encoded in a new ETStyle subclass named ETBasicItemStyle.

	* ETStyle:
	(-render:): Modified the return type to be void.
	(-render:layoutItem:dirtyRect:): New method.
	New class ETBasicItemStyle which encapsulates the code previously located
	in -[ETLayoutItem renderLayoutItem:].
	
	* ETLayoutItem
	Modified to inherit from ETStyle rather than ETStyleRenderer. Modified 
	the type of renderer property to ETStyle.
	(-initWithView:value:representedObject:): Modified to set ETBasicItemStyle 
	shared instance as the renderer.
	(-renderLayoutItem:): Removed by moving the code to 
	-[ETBasicItemStyle render:layoutItem:dirtyRect].
	(-render:dirtyRect:inView:): Modified to call the equivalenet ETStyle 
	method rather than -renderLayoutItem:.
	(-render:): Removed.
	
	* ETLayoutItemGroup
	Updated various part of the documentation related to the drawing.
	(-render:dirtyRect:inView:): Fixed to avoid the drawing of the item style 
	when a layout view is taking over the whole drawing. For example, switching 
	from a line layout to a table layout resulted in a visible row of items on 
	top of the table layout.
	
	* ETView: Documented INTERLEAVED_DRAWING.
	
	* ETStyleRenderer, ETRenderer: Removed various stuff (before getting rid 
	of these files at a later point).
	
	* PhotoViewExample: Tweaked to use no image views when the data source is 
	disabled, this example can now easily be used to test the direct drawing of 
	the layout item tree.

2008-08-25  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	Implemented the direct drawing of the layout items, so items without view can
	now draw themselves directly into the closest enclosing view. As a byproduct, 
	this also implies every items with or without a view can also be styled (for 
	stuff such as selection indicator, border etc.). The item style is currently 
	hardcoded but it is going to be modularized in order to be fully pluggable at 
	runtime. This feature can also be useful for implementing a graphics editor or 
	a photo browser, whose contents may consist of thousands of elements, hence 
	require lightweight items to diplay fast enough.
	Fixed selection handling in layouts that doesn't use a layout view and reenabled 
	the display of a visual indicator for selected items... a crude blue square :)
	WARNING: When scrolling a container made of items without views, the redisplay 
	doesn't occur transparently right now, clicking or resizing allows to workaround 
	this issue. In a similar vein, pick and drop work for both items with or without 
	view, but the result only becomes visible when you click or resize the container 
	if the picked items have no views.

	* ETLayout (-itemAtLocation:): Added a basic implementation to handle the 
	case where an item has no view.

	* ETView 
	(-drawRect:, -_recursiveDisplayAllDirtyWithLockFocus:visRect:, 
	-displayRectIgnoringOpacity:inContext:): Modified to take control of the 
	drawing once the subviews are drawn and ask the layout item to render itself.
	(-renderer): Used the layout item as the view renderer.

	* ETLayoutItem
	(-description): Tweaked the detailed description to print the frame.
	(-setImage:): Modified -setImage: to update the item size if needed.
	(-firstDecoratorItemWithSupervisorView, -drawingFrame, -renderLayoutItem:): 
	New methods.
	(-render:dirtyRect:inView:): Finished to implement and largely rewrote by 
	letting the parent item adjusting the graphic context to match our needs.
	(-renderer): Used the layout item as the view renderer.

	* ETLayoutItemGroup
	Documented several methods.
	(-render:dirtyRect:inView:): Finished to implement and largely rewrote. Now 
	calls -display:dirtyRect:inView: for adjusting the graphic context to each 
	child item.
	(-display:dirtyRect:inView:): New method.
	(-collectSelectionIndexPaths): Renamed  to
	-collectSelectionIndexPaths:relativeToItem: and modified to correctly 
	compute relative index paths of the selected items, rather than index paths 
	relative to the root item.
	(-applySelectionIndexPaths): Renamed to
	-applySelectionIndexPaths:relativeToItem: and fixed to correctly set the 
	selected items by interpreting the index paths as relative to the receiver.

2008-04-02  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>	

	* Headers/UKPluginsRegistry+Icons.h: Added.
        * Source/UKPluginsRegistry+Icons.m: Updated.
        * GNUmakefile:
        * Source/GNUmakefile:
        Updated to take in account the new header, cleaned a bit and modified 
        to link EtoileFoundation correctly with LIBRARIES_DEPEND_UPON.

2007-05-03 Yen-Ju Chen <yjchenx at gmail _dot_ com>

        * Toplevel GNUmakefile make the frameworks
          while Source/GNUmakefile make the subproject

2007-05-01 Yen-Ju Chen <yjchenx at gmail _dot_ com>

	* Turn into framework.

2007-02-28 Yen-Ju Chen <yjchenx at gmail _dot_ com>

	* Move UKNibOwner from EtoileFoundation (bug #8511).

2007-02-19 Yen-Ju Chen <yjchenx at gmail _dot_ com>

        * Format README in reStructuedText

2006-11-25  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>	

	* Source/NSImage+NiceScaling.m (-scaledSize:toFitSize:): Fixed ratio 
	computation bug that translated in a slight image distorsion.

2006-10-31  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>
	
	* Headers/Cocoa/Cocoa.h:
	* Headers/NSBezierPathCappedBoxes.h:
	* Headers/NSImage+NiceScaling.h:
	* Source/NSBezierPathCappedBoxes.m:
	* Source/NSImage+NiceScaling.m:
    * Source/GNUmakefile:
    * Source/GNUmakefile.postamble:
	* README:
	* INSTALL:
	* GNUmakefile:
	Imported this new framework resulting from the split of EtoileExtensionsKit
	in three modules (EtoileUI, EtoileFoundation, DistributedView).
	The framework has been created with svn cp on EtoileExtensionsKit to keep 
	files history.
