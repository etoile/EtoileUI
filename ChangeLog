	Implemented the direct drawing of the layout items, so items without view can
	now draw themselves directly into the closest enclosing view. As a byproduct, 
	this also implies every items with or without a view can also be styled (for 
	stuff such as selection indicator, border etc.). The item style is currently 
	hardcoded but it is going to be modularized in order to be fully pluggable at 
	runtime. This feature can also be useful for implementing a graphics editor or 
	a photo browser, whose contents may consist of thousands of elements, hence 
	require lightweight items to diplay fast enough.
	Fixed selection handling in layouts that doesn't use a layout view and reenabled 
	the display of a visual indicator for selected items... a crude blue square :)
	WARNING: When scrolling a container made of items without views, the redisplay 
	doesn't occur transparently right now, clicking or resizing allows to workaround 
	this issue. In a similar vein, pick and drop work for both items with or without 
	view, but the result only becomes visible when you click or resize the container 
	if the picked items have no views.

	* ETLayout (-itemAtLocation:): Added a basic implementation to handle the 
	case where an item has no view.

	* ETView 
	(-drawRect:, -_recursiveDisplayAllDirtyWithLockFocus:visRect:, 
	-displayRectIgnoringOpacity:inContext:): Modified to take control of the 
	drawing once the subviews are drawn and ask the layout item to render itself.
	(-renderer): Used the layout item as the view renderer.

	* ETLayoutItem
	(-description): Tweaked the detailed description to print the frame.
	(-setImage:): Modified -setImage: to update the item size if needed.
	(-firstDecoratorItemWithSupervisorView, -drawingFrame, -renderLayoutItem:): 
	New methods.
	(-render:dirtyRect:inView:): Finished to implement and largely rewrote by 
	letting the parent item adjusting the graphic context to match our needs.
	(-renderer): Used the layout item as the view renderer.

	* ETLayoutItemGroup
	Documented several methods.
	(-render:dirtyRect:inView:): Finished to implement and largely rewrote. Now 
	calls -display:dirtyRect:inView: for adjusting the graphic context to each 
	child item.
	(-display:dirtyRect:inView:): New method.
	(-collectSelectionIndexPaths): Renamed  to
	-collectSelectionIndexPaths:relativeToItem: and modified to correctly 
	compute relative index paths of the selected items, rather than index paths 
	relative to the root item.
	(-applySelectionIndexPaths): Renamed to
	-applySelectionIndexPaths:relativeToItem: and fixed to correctly set the 
	selected items by interpreting the index paths as relative to the receiver.

	Imported this new framework resulting from the split of EtoileExtensionsKit
	in three modules (EtoileUI, EtoileFoundation, DistributedView).
	The framework has been created with svn cp on EtoileExtensionsKit to keep 
	files history.
