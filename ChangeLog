2009-04-07 Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	Finished to rework the geometry model to be consistent and better support
	clipped content (e.g. when the content is scrollable). Now the frame is an
	implicit property computed on demand (as CoreAnimation does it). The API 
	hasn't really changed though and this shouldn't impact existing applications.
	* Container.xcodeproj: Updated.
	* ETLayoutItem, ETLayoutItemGroup:
	Reworked and finished the new geometry model. Many methods touched.
	Extracted the decorator support in a new class ETDecoratorItem and 
	introduced acommon class ETUIItem which factors code shared by ETLayouItem 
	and ETDecoratorItem. 
	* ETDecoratorItem:
	* ETScrollableAreaItem:
	Rewritten decorator related code almost entirely to use the new geometry 
	model.
	The decorator API is now easier to understand and cleaner.
	Renamed and rewritten -convertDisplayRect:toAncestorDisplayView: that 
	handles how damaged areas are propagated back to the views in charge of the 
	display. This method is now written in a recursive style to make the code 
	less complex and support to invalid areas on decorators (not yet used though).
	* ETWindowItem:
	Rewritten.
	* ETLayer.m:
	* ELLayoutItemBuilder:
	Fixed to create window items correctly.
	* ETView:
	Moved ETScrollView to ETScrollableAreaItem.
	Overriden frame related setters to notify the layout item about geometry 
	changes.
	* ETContainer: 
	Updated to use the right ETDecoratorItem type when needed.
	* test_ETLayoutItem:
	Updated to match new behaviors. Added some new geometry tests.

2009-03-18  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETLayoutItem:
	(-setView:): Removed the code that checks whether the new view should be 
	set as a supervisor view or not.
	* ETView:
	(-initWithFrame:layoutItem:): Updated to use -setSupervisorView: through 
	-setLayoutItem: since -initWithView: won't work now to set a supervisor 
	view.
	(-setLayoutItem:): Updated to use -setSupervisorView: as needed.
	* test_ETLayoutItem, test_ETView:
	Updated all tests that which were using -setView: or -initWithView: to 
	set a supervisor view.

2009-03-17  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETLayoutItem:
	(-view): Simplified -[ETLayoutItem view] to never return the supervisor view 
	itself but only its wrapped view.
	-(beginEditingUI): Updated to use -supervisorView.
	* ETLayoutItemGroup
	(-isContainer, -handleAttachViewOfItem:, -setVisibleItems:forItems:, 
	-itemScaleFactor, -visibleContentSize, -isScrollViewShown, -setContentSize:):
	 Updated to use -supervisorView.
	* ETLayoutItemGroup+Mutation:
	(-container): Updated to use -supervisorView.
	* ETLayout:
	Replaced -view by -supervisorView in ETLayoutingContext protocol.
	(-container): Updated to use -supervisorView.
	* test_ETLayoutItem, test_ETLayoutItemBuilder, test_ETView: 
	Updated to use -view and -supervisorView as expected.	

2009-03-09  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	Implemented sorting and searching in the layout item tree. The controller 
	layer is now mostly finished. This code remains to be tested.
	* ETController:
	New ivars _sortDescriptors, _filterPredicate, 
	_automaticallyRearranges, _hasNewSortDescriptors, _hasNewFilterPredicate, 
	_hasNewContent.
	(-init, -dealloc-: Updated.
	(-filterPredicate, -setFilterPredicate:, -automaticallyRearrangesObjects:, 
	-setAutomaticallyRearrangesObjects:): Added.
	* ETLayoutItemGroup:
	(+isAutolayoutEnabled, +enablesAutolayout, +disablesAutolayout): Added.
	Will probbly related instance methods in the long run.
	(-dealloc): Updated.
	(-properties): Removed 'layout' declaration now declared at ETLayoutItem 
	level.
	(-sortWithSortDescriptors:recursively:, -filterWithPredicate:recursively:, 
	-arrangedItems, -isSorted, -isFiltered): Added. These methods are used by 
	ETController.
	(-setSelectionIndexPaths:): Extracted some code into -didChangeSelection: 
	that lets external objects trigger selection notifications.
	(-didChangeSelection:): Added.

2009-03-08  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	New event handling model - part 3
	* ETLayoutItem
	New boundingBox and layout property. Added _boundingBox ivar.
	(-init): Updated to initialize boundingBox and have -setFlipped: alters the 
	supervisor view equivalent property as it should.
	(-usesWidgetView, -layout, -setLayout:, -setNeedsDisplayInRect:, 
	-displayRect:, -boundingBox, -setBoundingBox:): Added.
	(-properties): Updated to expose boundingBox, layout and autoresizingMask.
	(-setNeedsDisplay:): Moved the existing code into -setNeedsDisplayInRect:.
	(-display): Moved the existing code into -displayRect:.
	(-convertDisplayRect:toAncestorDisplayView:): Fixed to take in account 
	the case where the display view is NSThemeFrame and the content view must 
	be rather returned.
	(-respondsToSelector:, -methodSignatureForSelector:, -forwardInvocation:): 
	New methods to support the EtoileUI custom responder chain and to hand 
	actions to the action handler.
	* NSView+Etoile, Controls+Etoile:
	(-isWidget): Added.

2009-03-07  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETFreeLayout:
	Corrected header import statements to be local.
	(-loadPersistentFramesForItems:): Improved to check unitialized persistent 
	frame properly and documented.
	(-resetItemPersistentFramesWithLayout:): Renamed 
	-resetItemLocationsWithLayout: and rewrote it to eliminate dependency on 
	ETContainer and works with invisible items too. Documented too.

2009-03-06  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETLayoutItem:
	(-convertDisplayRect:toAncestorDisplayView:): Fixed an infinite loop issue 
	that occurs when trying to redisplay a rect which extends beyond the 
	boundaries of the topmost ancestor display view.
	(-setImage:): Modified to update the default frame with the image size, 
	otherwise the default frame is zero and any scaling done at layout time
	will always result in a negative size.
	* ETLayout:
	(-resizeLayoutItems:toScaleFactor:): Enabled scaling in all cases, now that 
	we can support it on layout items without a view.
	* ETLayoutItemGroup:
	(-display:item:dirtyRect:inView:): Fixed coordinate matrix corruption which 
	happens when -[ETLayout rootItem] returning a nil item in the calling 
	method.
	(-updateLayout:): Cleaned and documented.
	* ETStyle: 
	(-drawImage:flipped:inRect:): Fixed to work more or less on GNUstep by 
	using a flip transform. But... NSImage doesn't seem to always draw 
	themselves properly on GNUstep when the context uses flipped coordinates. 
	The new code also allows to safely draw cached images on Cocoa 
	(-[NSImage setFlipped:] isn't reliable in that case).

2009-03-05  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* Collage:
	Added a preliminary structured graphics editor example.

2009-02-17  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETLayoutItem:
	(-initWithView:value:representedObject:): Turned flipped coordinates on by 
	default.
	(-setSupervisorView:): Modified to sync the new supervisor view with the 
	flipped property of the layout item.
	(-setFrame:): Modified to notify the style object about bounds change.

2009-02-15  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETView:
	(-release): Rewritten retain cycle management code/doc a bit to be easier to 
	understand.
	(-_recursiveDisplayAllDirtyWithLockFocus:visRect:): Modified to mark 
	_wasJustRedrawn.
	(_recursiveDisplayRectIfNeededIgnoringOpacity:isVisibleRect:rectIsVisibleRectForView:):
	Added to truly redraw properly on Mac OS X in all cases.
	(-[ETScrollView initWithFrame:layoutItem:]): Modified to use no scrollers 
	by default, otherwise -[ETContainer hasVerticalScroller] wrongly starts to 
	return YES once the layout is switched, because -setLayoutView: causes the 
	scroll view decorator to be created like that:
	-[ETContainer createScrollViewDecoratorItem]
	-[ETContainer scrollView]
	-[ETContainer hasVerticalScroller]
	-[ETContainer syncDisplayViewWithContainer]
	-[ETContainer setLayoutView:]
	* ETContainer:
	(-setHasVerticalScroller:, -setHasHorizontalScoller:): Imrproved to only 
	insert the scroll view decorator when a scroller becomes a visible.
	(-createScrollViewDecoratorItem): Added an assertion to check the scroller 
	visibility meet our expectations.

2009-02-14  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETStyle:
	(-[ETStyle didChangeItemBounds:]): Added.
	ETBasicItemStyle
	(-render:layoutItem:dirtyRect:): Updated.
	(-drawImage:flipped:inRect:): Modified to draw properly even if the item is 
	flipped.
	(-drawStackIndicatorInRect:): Added.

2009-01-30  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETLayoutItemGroup:
	(-render:dirtyRect:inView:): Modified to draw the layout item tree 
	encapsulated in the layout, this way we can really support arbitrary UI 
	composition.
	(-display:item:dirtyRect:inView:): Fixed to check the flipping correctly. 
	(-unmakeGroup): Rewritten to be usable.

2009-01-30  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETLayoutItemGroup:
	For clarity, splitted the index and path based informal source protocol into 
	two distinct protocols.
	(-itemsWithSubviewsOfView:): Moved to ETLayoutItemBuilder.
	(-handleAttachViewOfItem:, -handleDetachViewOfItem:, -handleAttachItem:, 
	-handleDetachItem:): Improved the documentation and tidied the code a bit.
	Improved and reformatted the documentation of methods related to the 
	represented object or source object.
	* ETLayoutItemBuilder:
	(-renderView:): Improved to set the persistent frame on each built item. 
	Thereby the existing view frames are never lost when we set a layout 
	(by default the layout of each built item group is nil here).

2009-01-30  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETLayer:
	Added an experimental ETWindowLayout with the possibility to switch the 
	layout of the window layer from a WM-based layout to a layout such as 
	outline, table, flow etc.
	ETWindowLayer
	Added _visibleWindows and _rootWindow ivar.
	(-init, -dealloc): Updated.
	(-_createRetainedRootWindow, -hideHardWindows, -showHardWindows): Added.

	* ETLayout:
	(-setLayoutContext:): Documented new display view removal code in details.
	(-render:isNewContent): Moved layout context check to -canRender. Moved 
	code incorrectly disabled that removes display views to -setLayoutContext:.

2009-01-28  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETContainer:
	Removed ETContainerSelectionDidChangeNotification.
	* ETLayoutItemGroup:
	Added ETItemGroupSelectionDidChangeNotification. Updated and reformatted 
	selection related method documentation. Removed some unecessary extra tabs 
	in the methods.
	(-setSelectionIndexPaths:): Updated to send the new notification to the 
	delegate.
	* ETPaneLayout, ETPaneSwitcherLayout, ETInspector, ETTableLayout:  Updated 
	to use the new notification.

2009-01-28  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	declaration to ETLayoutItemGroup source protocol.
	* ETContainer:
	(-displayedItemPropertiesInContainer:): Removed.
	* ETInspector, ETViewModelLayout, ETTableLayout, ETObjectBrowserLayout, 
	ObjectManagerExample, PhotoViewExample:
	Updated to use the new method.

2009-01-27  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETLayoutItemGroup:
	Moved ETContainer index path-based source protocol to ETLayoutItemGroup, in 
	that way it is centered around the base item.
	(-itemGroup:numberOfItemsAtPath:, itemGroup:itemAtPath:): Added.
	* ETContainer:
	(-numberOfItemsInContainer:, container:itemAtIndex:):
	(-container:numberOfItemsAtPath::, container:itemAtPath:):
	Removed.
	* ETLayoutItemGroup+Mutation, ETInspector, ETBrowserLayout, 
	ETObjectBrowserLayout, ObjectManagerExample:
	Updated to use the new index path-based source protocol.

2009-01-27  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETLayoutItemGroup:
	Moved ETContainer index-based source protocol to ETLayoutItemGroup, in that 
	way it is centered around the base item.
	(-numberOfItemsInItemGroup:, itemGroup:itemAtIndex:): Added.
	* ETContainer:
	(-numberOfItemsInContainer:, container:itemAtIndex:): Deprecated
	* ETLayoutItemGroup+Mutation, ETViewModelLayout, ObjectManagerExample, 
	  PhotoViewExample, PaneExample:
	Updated to use the new index-based source protocol.
	Also improved PhotoViewExample to take in account composite layout when the 
	positional constraints are altered.

2009-01-27  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETLayoutItemGroup:
	(-source):
	(-setSource:):
	New methods moved out of ETContainer.
	* ETContainer:
	Removed _dataSource ivar (now declared as a property on ETLayoutItemGroup).
	(-source, -setSource:): Deprecated.

2009-01-26  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETLayoutItem:
	Added kETRepresentedPathProperty. Moved property access macros to 
	ETCompatibility.h
	(-representedPathBase): Modified to return the property rather than nil 
	by default.
	* ETLayoutItemGroup:
	(-representedPathBase): Removed this overriden method version.
	(-setRepresentedPathBase:): New method based on the old 
	-[ETContainer representedPath].
	* ETContainer:
	Removed _path ivar (now declared as a property on ETLayoutItem).
	(-representedPath, -setRepresentedPath:): Deprecated.

2009-01-24  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETContainer (-dealloc): Fixed a nasty double release error by removing 
	DESTROY(_layoutView). This ivar is weak reference, hence this line results 
	in an extra release that translates in more or less random crashes when a 
	view-based layout is released. Here is the sequence that leads to the crash:
	- an item group is deallocated and it releases its layout
	- the layout is deallocated and releases its layout view	
	At this point the layout view is still retained by the container as a subview
	... but later:
	- the container is deallocated and wrongly releases its layout view (which 
	was not retained in -setLayoutView:)
	- the layout view is deallocated
	- the container deallocation code terminates with [super dealloc] which 
	tries to release its subviews and thereby crashes when trying to send 
	-removeFromSuperview to the deallocated layout view.
	The crash happens very often on a window close which releases the layout 
	item tree it decorates. This fix should also solve random crashes that were 
	reported when the application terminates (and closes its windows).
	
2009-01-19  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETViewModelLayout:
	Corrected header import statements.
	New ivar _shouldInspectRepresentedObjectAsView. Documented API.
	(-awakeFromNib): Replaced the table layout by an outline one. Improved the 
	the column header readability and look by providing property display names. 
	Increased how much content can be viewed without scrolling or resizing by 
	setting the property view content font size to small.
	(-shouldInspectRepresentedObjectAsView, 
	-setShouldInspectRepresentedObjectAsView:, -inspectedItem): Added.
	Added a category to ETInstanceVariable to make each ivar object traversable 
	by explosing it as a collection of ivars if the ivar value is an object.
	(-doubleClickInPropertyView:): Rewritten to use -explore:.
	(-setLayoutContext:): Removed.
	(-object:itemRepresentingSlotAtIndex:, -numberOfSlotsInObject:): Rewritten 
	to better leverage EtoileFoundation reflection layer. Temporarily disabled 
	the listing of methods.
	(-numberOfItemsInContainer:): Tweaked to make use of 
	-shouldInspectRepresentedObjectAsView.
	* NSObject+EtoileUI: 
	Added -explore: to inspect objects with developer-centric inspector based 
	on ETViewModelLayout. Still a bit rough...

2009-01-19  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETLayoutItem+Factory:
	Corrected header import statements.
	(+itemGroupWithRepresentedObject:): Added.

	+oval): Added various shape-based item factory methods.

2009-01-19  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* Headers/ETShape.h:
	* Source/ETShape.m:
	Removed previous code and added new class ETShape.

2009-01-19  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	Rewritten the basic inspector support to be entirely handled outside of 
	ETContainer.
	* ETContainer:
	Corrected EtoileUI header import statements to be local.
	Removed _inspector ivar and related code in -initWithFrame:layoutItem: and 
	-dealloc.
	Removed ETObjectInspection conformance.
	(-inspect:, -inspectSelection:): Deprecated and rewritten to rely on 
	NSObject+EtoileUI and ETLayoutItem.
	(-setInspector:, -inspector, -inspectorForItems:): Removed.
	* ETLayoutItem:
	New property kETInspectorProperty.
	(-validateUserInterfaceItem:): Added. This will be used by the new event 
	handling model.
	(-showInspectorPanel): Removed.

	inspectedObjects.
	* ETInspector: Removed the deprecated inspectedItems accessors.

2009-01-18  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETApplication (-finishLaunching): Fixed the missing title of the 
	application menu on GNUstep and the repeated logging of 'Services menu not 
	in main menu!'. This bug was recently introduced with r4188.

2009-01-09  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	Optimized drawing to only redraw dirty portion of the layout item tree. 
	More documentation.

	if no view is provided.
	(-isBaseItem, -closestAncestorItemWithDisplayView, 
	-convertDisplayRect:toAncestorDisplayView:, -boundingBox, 
	-convertRectToParent:fromItem:, -convertRect:toItem:, -acceptsActions): 
	Added.
	(-setSelected:): Made KVO compliant.
	(-setNeedsDisplay:, -display): Rewritten to only trigger the redraw of the 
	receiver area in the view hierarchy. The dirty rect is computed with 
	-convertDisplayRect:toAncestorDisplayView:.

2008-12-30  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	Extended ETApplication with a new Arrange built-in menu and the possibility 
	to instantiate a main controller specified in the info plist of the 
	application bundle.
	Corrected header import statements.
	* ETApplication:
	Added ETApp macro. Documented the class a bit more. New enum for menu item
	tags.

	kETFlippedProperty, kETAnchorPointProperty and kETNeedsDisplay. Added 
	HAS_PROPERTY macro.
	(-display, -bounds, -centeredAnchorPoint, -anchorPoint, -setAnchorPoint:
	-position, -setPosition:): Added.
	(-setFlipped:): Modified to adjust the anchor point if needed.
	(-isFlipped): Added a check to ensure -isFlipped is consistent between 
	the supervisor view and the item.
	(-defaultFrame, -setDefaultFrame:): Modified to store its value in the 
	variable properties and returns a null rect by default.

2008-12-15  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	New event handling model - part 2
	Added an ETActionHandler skeleton that will replace the event handler 
	logic located in ETLayoutItem+Events.
	Added new geometry methods to ETLayoutItem that will be used to dispatch 
	events in the layout item tree.
	* ETLayoutItem:
	(-eventHandler): Deprecated.
	(-actionHandler, -setActionHandler): Added. Thought to replace -eventHandler.
	(-convertRectToParent:, -convertRectFromParent:): Rewritten to work properly.
	(-convertPointToParent:, -convertPointFromParent:, -containsPoint:, 
	-pointInside:, -isFlipped): Added.
	(-copyWithZone:, -dealloc): Updated to take in account the action handler.
	(-init): Ditto. Also modified to initialize the property dictionary
	immediately rather than lazily in -variableProperties.
	* ETLayoutItem+Events:
	Added an ETActionHandler skeleton.
	
2008-12-12  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	Turned ETContainer(ETController) into a standalone ETController class.
	* ETContainer:
	Moved _objectClass, _groupClass, _templateItem and _templateItemGroup ivars 
	to ETController.
	* ETController:
	Added _content ivar.
	(-init, -dealloc, -setContent:, -selectionIndex, -setSelectionIndex:,

	ETLayoutItemGroup+Mutation category.
	* ETLayoutItemGroup+Mutation:
	Declared kETControllerProperty.
	* test_ETController.m: Updated.

2008-12-08  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	New event handling model - part 1
	* ETEvent:
	Rewritten ETEvent to be a standalone event class that wraps backend events 
	rather than an NSEvent subclass. NSEvent initializers don't expose all 
	the initialization, so the subclass choice was troublesome.
	* ETLayoutItem+Events (-beginDrag:forItem:image:layout:): Updated to pass a 
	backend event to an AppKit drag related method.

2008-09-04  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETLayout 
	New work-in-progress protocols ETPositionalLayout and ETCompositeLayout.
	(-isComposite): Added.
	(-resizeLayoutItems:toScaleFactor:, -setItemSizeConstraintStyle:): 
	Documented.
	(-render:isNewContent:): Commented out the call to -setVisibleItems:, so the 
	visibility of the items is only handled in 
	-renderWithLayoutItems:isNewContent:.

2008-09-04  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETLayout (-resizeLayoutItems:toScaleFactor:): Applied item size contraint 
	only if requested, when -itemSizeConstraintStyle returns another value than 
	ETSizeConstraintStyleNone. This fixes the case where a zero size is 
	returned by -constrainedItemSize and wrongly applied with the scaling.

2008-09-03  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	Extracted -[ETBasicItemStyle render:layoutItem:dirtyRect:] into two new 
	methods. Enhanced existing code to draw a way more pretty selection 
	indicator (light gray interior, dark gray border), instead of the boring 
	blue square that was playing this role until then.
	* ETStyle.[hm]:
	(-[ETBasicItemStyle render:layoutItem:dirtyRect:]): Modularized the drawing 
	code into two new methods.
	(-[ETBasicItemStyle drawImage:]):
	(-[ETBasicItemStyle drawSelectionIndicatorInRect:]):
	Added.

2008-09-03  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	Made possible to create application without nibs on Mac OS X, by writing 
	the code that builds and installs the main menu. This will make the 
	maintenance of EtoileUI examples less a burden, no nibs and gorms to 
	keep in sync.
	* ETApplication
	More documentation.
	(-_buildMainMenuIfNeeded, -_createApplicationMenu): New methods.
	(-finishLaunching): Updated to call -_buildMainMenuIfNeeded.

2008-08-31  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETLayout 
	(-tearDown, -selectionDidChangeInLayoutContext): New methods.
	(-setLayoutContext:): Modified to call -tearDown if needed.
	* ETLayoutItemGroup (-setLayout:): Cleansed. Moved layout view removal code
	to -[ETLayout tearDown] since the layout is responsible of the layout view.
	
2008-08-31  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETLayout
	(-render:isNewContent:): Cleaned. Extracted the code that sets the initial 
	layout size into a new method -resetLayoutSize.
	(-canRender, -resetLayoutSize): Added.
	(-renderWithLayoutItems:isNewContent:): Moved up the item scaling call 
	from ETComputedLayout, and added a call to -resetLayoutSize so that the 
	initial layout is now set here instead of -render:isNewContent:.
	* ETComputedLayout (-renderWithLayoutItems:isNewContent:): Moved the item 
	scaling back into ETLayout, so that it can be shared with other subclasses.
	* ETFreeLayout: Fixed two compilation warnings (temporary fix).

2008-08-31  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETLayout, ETComputedLayout:
	(-layoutLineForLayoutItems:, -layoutModelForLayoutItems:, 
	-computeLayoutItemLocationsForLayoutModel:): Moved down to ETComputedLayout 
	subclass from ETLayout.
	(-renderWithLayoutItems:isNewContent:): Moved implementation down to 
	ETComputedLayout.
	* ETPaneLayout, ETPaneSwitcherLayout: Updated to get rid of the compilation
	warnings triggered by these changes. Temporary fix until these classes are
	rewritten.

2008-08-28  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ETLayout (-resizeItems:toScaleFactor:): Fixed by removing an unwanted bit 
	of code, the items should now be scaled even when no item size constraint is 
	set.
	
	* ETFlowLayout, ETLineLayout, ETStackLayout: 
	Defined subclass relative default values for item margin, item size 
	constraint and item constrained size. May need to be tweaked to be really 
	sensible.

2008-08-28  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	Implemented item margin for flow, line and stack layouts. A big step for a
	real photo view and an incremental step towards form layout :-)
	Added a new abstract class ETComputedLayout, that will be useful to extract 
	state and behavior ETLayout.

	* ETLayout: 
	Declared protocol ETPositionalLayout.
	(-isPositional): Added.
	(-isComputedLayout): Modified to return NO and updated the doc.
	
	* ETFlowLayout, ETStackLayout:
	Modified to inherit from ETComputedLayout and modified the layout 
	rendering methods to take in account the item margin.
	
	* ETComputedLayout.[hm]: Added.
	* EtoileUI.h: Included ETComputedLayout.h.
	* Container.xcodeproj, GNUmakefile: Updated.
	* PhotoViewExample: Added a slider to control the item margin. Only modified 
	the nib but not the gorm file yet.

2008-08-25  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	Modularized the drawing of the layout items, the default rendering style 
	is now encoded in a new ETStyle subclass named ETBasicItemStyle.

	* ETStyle:
	(-render:): Modified the return type to be void.
	(-render:layoutItem:dirtyRect:): New method.
	New class ETBasicItemStyle which encapsulates the code previously located
	in -[ETLayoutItem renderLayoutItem:].
	
	* ETLayoutItem
	Modified to inherit from ETStyle rather than ETStyleRenderer. Modified 
	the type of renderer property to ETStyle.
	(-initWithView:value:representedObject:): Modified to set ETBasicItemStyle 
	shared instance as the renderer.
	(-renderLayoutItem:): Removed by moving the code to 
	-[ETBasicItemStyle render:layoutItem:dirtyRect].
	(-render:dirtyRect:inView:): Modified to call the equivalenet ETStyle 
	method rather than -renderLayoutItem:.
	(-render:): Removed.
	
	* ETLayoutItemGroup
	Updated various part of the documentation related to the drawing.
	(-render:dirtyRect:inView:): Fixed to avoid the drawing of the item style 
	when a layout view is taking over the whole drawing. For example, switching 
	from a line layout to a table layout resulted in a visible row of items on 
	top of the table layout.
	
	* ETView: Documented INTERLEAVED_DRAWING.
	
	* ETStyleRenderer, ETRenderer: Removed various stuff (before getting rid 
	of these files at a later point).
	
	* PhotoViewExample: Tweaked to use no image views when the data source is 
	disabled, this example can now easily be used to test the direct drawing of 
	the layout item tree.

2008-08-25  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	Implemented the direct drawing of the layout items, so items without view can
	now draw themselves directly into the closest enclosing view. As a byproduct, 
	this also implies every items with or without a view can also be styled (for 
	stuff such as selection indicator, border etc.). The item style is currently 
	hardcoded but it is going to be modularized in order to be fully pluggable at 
	runtime. This feature can also be useful for implementing a graphics editor or 
	a photo browser, whose contents may consist of thousands of elements, hence 
	require lightweight items to diplay fast enough.
	Fixed selection handling in layouts that doesn't use a layout view and reenabled 
	the display of a visual indicator for selected items... a crude blue square :)
	WARNING: When scrolling a container made of items without views, the redisplay 
	doesn't occur transparently right now, clicking or resizing allows to workaround 
	this issue. In a similar vein, pick and drop work for both items with or without 
	view, but the result only becomes visible when you click or resize the container 
	if the picked items have no views.

	* ETLayout (-itemAtLocation:): Added a basic implementation to handle the 
	case where an item has no view.

	* ETView 
	(-drawRect:, -_recursiveDisplayAllDirtyWithLockFocus:visRect:, 
	-displayRectIgnoringOpacity:inContext:): Modified to take control of the 
	drawing once the subviews are drawn and ask the layout item to render itself.
	(-renderer): Used the layout item as the view renderer.

	* ETLayoutItem
	(-description): Tweaked the detailed description to print the frame.
	(-setImage:): Modified -setImage: to update the item size if needed.
	(-firstDecoratorItemWithSupervisorView, -drawingFrame, -renderLayoutItem:): 
	New methods.
	(-render:dirtyRect:inView:): Finished to implement and largely rewrote by 
	letting the parent item adjusting the graphic context to match our needs.
	(-renderer): Used the layout item as the view renderer.

	* ETLayoutItemGroup
	Documented several methods.
	(-render:dirtyRect:inView:): Finished to implement and largely rewrote. Now 
	calls -display:dirtyRect:inView: for adjusting the graphic context to each 
	child item.
	(-display:dirtyRect:inView:): New method.
	(-collectSelectionIndexPaths): Renamed  to
	-collectSelectionIndexPaths:relativeToItem: and modified to correctly 
	compute relative index paths of the selected items, rather than index paths 
	relative to the root item.
	(-applySelectionIndexPaths): Renamed to
	-applySelectionIndexPaths:relativeToItem: and fixed to correctly set the 
	selected items by interpreting the index paths as relative to the receiver.

	* Headers/UKPluginsRegistry+Icons.h: Added.
        * Source/UKPluginsRegistry+Icons.m: Updated.
        * GNUmakefile:
        * Source/GNUmakefile:
        Updated to take in account the new header, cleaned a bit and modified 
        to link EtoileFoundation correctly with LIBRARIES_DEPEND_UPON.

2007-05-03 Yen-Ju Chen <yjchenx at gmail _dot_ com>

        * Toplevel GNUmakefile make the frameworks
          while Source/GNUmakefile make the subproject

	Imported this new framework resulting from the split of EtoileExtensionsKit
	in three modules (EtoileUI, EtoileFoundation, DistributedView).
	The framework has been created with svn cp on EtoileExtensionsKit to keep 
	files history.
