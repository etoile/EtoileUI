/* Collection Access and Mutation Protocols */

@protocol ETCollection
- (BOOL) isOrdered;
- (BOOL) isEmpty;
/** Returns the underlying data structure object holding the content or self 
	when the protocol is adopted by a class which is a content data structure 
	by itself (like NSArray, NSDictionary, NSSet etc.). 
	Content by its very nature is always a collection of other objects. As 
	such, content may hold one or no objects (empty collection).
	When adopted, this method must never return nil. */
- (id) content;
/** Returns the content as an NSArray-based collection of objects. 
	When adopted, this method must never return nil, you should generally 
	return an empty NSArray instead. */
- (NSArray *) contentArray;
/** Returns an enumerator which can be used as a conveniency to iterate over 
	the elements of the content one-by-one. */
//- (NSEnumerator *) objectEnumerator;
/** Returns the number of elements hold by the receiver. */
//- (unsigned int) count;

// FIXME: Both objectEnumerator and count are problematic because they are 
// declared on NSArray, NSDictionary etc. therefore the compiler complains about
// unimplemented method when the protocol is adopted by a category on the 
// collection. I think the compiler should be smart enough to check whether the
// original class already declares/implements the method or not. 
// -isEmpty and -objectEnumerator could be put in a ETCollectionMixin because
// their implementation doesn't vary.
@end

@protocol ETCollectionMutation
- (void) addObject: (id)object;
- (void) removeObject: (id)object;
// NOTE: Next method could allow to simplify type checking of added and removed
// objects and provides -addObject: -removeObject: implementation in a mixin.
// For example you could declare elementType as ETLayoutItem to ensure proper 
// type checking. If you check against [self class], in ETLayoutItemGroup you
// won't be able to accept ETLayoutItem instances. So the valid common supertype
// of collection objects must be declared in a superclass if you define subtype
// for collection objects. ETLayer and ETLayoutItemGroup are such subtypes of 
// ETLayoutItem.
//- (NSString *) elementType;
