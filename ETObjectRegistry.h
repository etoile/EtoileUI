/** ETObjectRegistry class provides a prototype-system which allows to infer
	both state and behaviors of Etoile objects based on other objects. State
	and behaviors inference only happens per request.
	
	ETObjectRegistry provides an interface to the Cascading Object Registries 
	concept. Every object aspects which needs to be kept automatically in sync 
	with other objects can be put in an object registry. The object registries
	are by nature organized in a tree structure which allows to look up for an
	aspect in a more broad registry when the local registry bound the object
	cannot provide a value directly. This mechanism is very close to CSS 
	(Cascading Style Sheets) resolution and overriding rules, that's why 
	ETObjectRegistry instances create Cascading Object Registries or Object
	Registry Tree.
	
	Each lookup in the Object Registry Tree can result in a lookup chain 
	moving up through towards the root registry.
	
	To bind an object to an object registry...
	[myCircle setObjectRegistry: polygonRegistry]
	
	To bind only a special kind of object registry...
	[[myCircle objectRegistry] setStyleRegistry: [polygonRegistry styleRegistry]]
	
	Typical uses of this class includes styles, layouts, filters, object 
	palettes etc. Further uses could be developed like system shared resources,
	constraint-based computations, item animations and anything which rely 
	heavily on external state or behaviors to be shared with other objects.
	
	The current implementation is self-sufficient, but in future the underlying
	mechanism will surely use CoreObject when it is available on the host system.
	
	This class is heavily used in EtoileUI framework. */
