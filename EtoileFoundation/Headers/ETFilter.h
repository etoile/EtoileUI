/** Filter class is widely used in both EtoileFoundation and higher level 
	frameworks like EtoileUI to implement pervasive late-binding of behavior
	or state. Object chains are implemented as a linked lists.
	Many classes in EtoileFoundation and EtoileUI are subclasses of ETFilter
	and thereby benefit from the built-in support of delegation chain.
	In addition to delegation and changing behavior of objects at runtime,
	the class also provides a common interface for applying transforms.
	See ETTransform and related subclasses.
	Take note ETStyle provides a mostly identical class in EtoileUI. ETStyle is
	state oriented, it is used to represent objects that have a visual 
	representation or translation (like style, layout, brush stroke etc.) and
	display them on screen. 
	ETFilter is behavior-oriented, it is used to handle filtering, 
	transforming and converting where you give data in input and you get 
	other data in output. 
	
	input | type  |  output
	data -> style -> display
	data -> filter -> data  
	
	ETStyle is a typical renderer object. */
