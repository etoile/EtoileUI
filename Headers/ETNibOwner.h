/** You can use ETNibOwner or a subclass instance to easily load a nib, the 
instance will be set as the File's Owner proxy, and when released it will 
automatically release the Nib resources (e.g. the Nib top-level objects). 

Once a nib owner has been instantiated, the nib isn't loaded until -loadNib 
is invoked.<br />
In the example below, we show how to use ETNibOwner:

<example>
// First declare a ETNibOwner subclass to manage the nib
@interface InspectorNibOwner : ETNibOwner
@end

@implementation InspectorNibOwner
- (void) didLoadNib
{
	NSLog(@"Inspector nib is now loaded and awaken");
}
@end
</example>

<example>
// Then use InspectorNibOwner to load the nib
InspectorNibOwner *nibOwner = [[InspectorNibOwner alloc] initWithNibName: @"Inspector" bundle: nil];

[nibOwner loadNib]; // Will invoke -didLoadNib 
</example>

When writing an EtoileUI application, the best choice is usually to use 
[ETController] (or a subclass) to manage a Nib rather than ETNibOwner directly.

To finish the Nib loading, e.g. render the AppKit view hierarchy into a layout 
item tree, retrieve items or views, override some aspects or reorganize the 
view hierarchy or the item tree, don't override -awakeFromNib but -didLoadNib 
which will be called once every objects in the Nib has received -awakeFromNib.
When a layout item tree is built in this way, both views and windows become 
owned by the items in the resulting tree. Previously the view/window ownership 
was in relationships such as top-level objects, subviews or content views.

To render an AppKit view hierarchy packaged in a Nib into a layout item tree, 
-rebuildTopLevelObjectsWithBuilder: can be used.<br />
For example, ETController overrides -didLoadNib in a vein similar to:

<example>
- (void) didLoadNib
{
	[self rebuildTopLevelObjectsWithBuilder: [ETEtoileUIBuilder builder]];
}
</example>

For every top-level object, when -render: on the builder returns a new object, 
-rebuildTopLevelObjectsWithBuilder: substitutes the initial object with the new 
one in the top-level object array (see -topLevelObjects).<br />
When the AppKit view hierarchy to render is in the main Nib, see 
[ETApplication-rebuildMainNib]. 

On instantiation with a nil Nib name, an object which inherits from ETNibOwner 
automatically loads the Nib file which is named just like the concrete 
ETNibOwner subclass it is an instance of.<br />
For example, a direct instance of the ETNibOwner subclass "PreferencesPanel"
would try to load the Nib file named "PreferencesPanel.nib". */
