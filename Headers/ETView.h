/** ETView is the generic view class extensively used by EtoileUI. It 
	implements several facilities in addition to the ones already provided by
	NSView. If you want to write Etoile-native UI code, you should always use
	or subclass ETView and not NSView when you need a custom view and you don't
	rely an AppKit-specific NSView subclasses.
	Take note that if you want to add subviews (or child items) you should use
	ETContainer and not ETView which throws exceptions if you try to call 
	-addSubview: directly.
	
	A key feature is additional control and flexibility over the 
	drawing process. It lets you sets a render delegate by calling 
	-setRenderer:. This delegate can implement -render:  method to avoid the 
	tedious subclassing involved by -drawRect:. 
	More importantly, -render: isn't truly a delegated version of -drawRect:. 
	This new method enables the possibility to draw directly over the subviews 
	by offering another drawing path. This drawing option is widely used in 
	EtoileUI and is the entry point of every renderer chains when they are 
	asked to render themselves on screen. See Display Tree Description if you
	want to know more. 
	
	An ETView instance is also always bound to a layout item unlike NSView 
	instances. When a view is set on a layout item, when this view isn't an
	ETView class or subclass instance, ETLayoutItem automatically wraps the
	view in an ETView making possible to apply renderers, styles etc. over the
	real view.
	
	ETView also offers a customizable title bar. The title bar visibility can
	always be turned on or off. By default, it's turned off. If you are in 
	Live Development mode, most view title bars are usually visible and are 
	tuned for live UI editing with various buttons to switch between available
	edition modes like view, model, object, component etc. By clicking and 
	dragging a title bar in Live Development you can edit your UI layout. 
	Outside of Live Development mode, title bars support collapse and expand
	operations (think of it as window shading at view level) which is useful
	to build complex inspectors or very flexible UI based on disclosable views.
	Title bar support also means an ETContainer embedding ETView instances and 
	using a layout of type ETFreeLayout will give you a built-in window manager.
	Title bar views can be customized at application-level by setting a title
	bar view prototype to be reused by all instances. Instance-by-instance 
	customization is also possible by calling -setTitleBarView:, in this case
	calling +setTitleBarViewPrototype: will never be reflected at instance 
	level until you call -setTitleBarView: nil which resets the title bar to 
	the class-shared prototype.

// TODO: Implement ETTitleBarView subclass to handle the title bar as a layout
// item which can be introspected and edited at runtime. A subclass is 
// necessary to create the title bar of title bars in a lazy way, otherwise
// ETView instantiation would lead to infinite recursion on the title bar set up.
