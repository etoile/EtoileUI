/** EtoileUI binds to all objects a visual representation. In many cases, such
	representations are created only on demand.
	Any UI objects like (ETView, ETLayoutItem etc.) responds to -view: by 
	becoming frontmost UI objects and focused. Take note, this may involve 
	changing both the frontmost application and window).
	Non-UI objects are returned by looking up for a service or a component 
	which is registered in CoreObject as a viewer or editor for this object 
	type. If none can be found, the lookup continues by trying to find a 
	viewer/editor through CoreObject supercasting mechanism. If the fallback
	occurs on a raw data viewer/editor, -view: method doesn't handle by itself
	the viewing but delegates it to -inspect: which displays a basic object
	inspector built around ETModelViewLayout. 
	When a new UI object is created or when -view: is called on an object, in
	both cases the object represented by the UI object is registered as opened
	in the layout item registry. Any subsequent invocations of -view won't create
	a new visual representation but move the registered representation back to
	front. The layout item registry is a shared instance which can be accessed 
	by calling -[ETObjectRegistry(EtoileUI) layoutItemRegistry].
