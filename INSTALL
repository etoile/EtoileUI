EtoileUI INSTALL
================

Required software
-----------------

You need to have the GNUstep core libraries installed in order to compile and 
use EtoileUI. The core packages are, at a minimum:

   * gnustep-make

   * gnustep-base

   * gnustep-gui

   * gnustep-back

   See <http://www.gnustep.org/> for further information.

Finally you need from Etoile itself:

   * EtoileFoundation, which can be found in Etoile/Frameworks/EtoileFoundation

This last dependency is automatically handled when EtoileUI is built by running
'make' tool in Frameworks or any other parent directories.


Build and Install
-----------------

Square brackets "[ ]" are used to indicate optional parameters.

   Steps to build (use gmake on non-GNU systems):

   * make

   * [sudo [-E]] make install
