/** The composition of layouts is a mechanism that allows to compose a layout 
    item tree playing only a presentation role, into a another layout item tree 
    that is characterized by a semantic role.
    The composition of layouts allows to compose layout item trees without 
    altering the structure of a target tree and as such to profoundly alter 
    its presentation without touching the semantic that is encoded by the 
    structure.
    When a composite layout is set on an item group, its children are routed 
    to the layout of a node of the item tree encapsulated in the layout. 
    Routed means the children item aren't attached to the internal item tree but 
    just passed to a target layout for which a target item exists in the 
    internal item tree.
    You can create a composite layout by subclassing and overriding methods like 
    -targetItem, -rootItem or you can create one dynamically by passing a 
    presentational layout item tree to be composed to -initWithRootItem:. 
    ETCompositeLayout encapsulates a presentational tree that doesn't appear 
    in the layout item group to which the layout is applied to. 
    Another way to look at composite layouts is to see them as inner decorator 
    items unlike decorator items you can set on ETLayoutItem instances which are 
    outer decorators. */
