	stability (more commonly named spatiality in the case of UI objects).
	If the receiver is a layout item, this layout item is simply brought to 
	front and made the first responder. 
	When the receiver is some other kind of objects, the object registry is 
	looked up to know whether there is a layout item bound to the receiver.
	If the lookup succeeds, the matching layout item is requested to display
	itself by sending -view: to it.
	If no visual representation exists, a new layout item is created and 
	bound to the receiver with the object registry. Then this layout item is
	made visible and active as described in the previous paragraph. */

	or bring back the basic inspector. */
