	Rendering tree is an extension of renderer support, this extension is 
	useful essentially in imaging applications either vector or bitmap based.

	Rendering is the step which precedes display and encompass both layout and
	real time graphics computation.
	A renderer tree would be roughly identical to GEGL model.
	Layout item tree and renderer tree form two parallel trees which are 
	bridged together and ruled by layout items. 
	At each layout item node, a renderer branch is connected.
	Both trees are visited together from top to bottom at rendering time.
	At rendering time, a visitor object which encapsulates the rendering state
	is passed through layout items:
	- it enters a layout item
	- it visits the item renderer branch and computes it if needed
	- it memorizes the first renderer directly connected to the layout item
	- it quits the layout item
	- it enters a second layout item
	- it checks whether the first renderer of the layout item has a second 
	input if we put aside renderer branch which plays the first input role; if
	no second input is present, it uses the last memorized renderer in this 
	role
	- it removes the last memorized renderer of the second input if necessary
	- it memorizes the renderer connected to the second layout
	- it quits the layout item
