# Open Issues

* Verify NSView hidden property doesn't cause a KVC error when read or written, it caused a crash in the object browser layout in the past.

* Fix group and ungroup operations. That shouldn't be really hard. The only thing is to settle on a sensible semantic: where a new group is inserted and where the child items of a dismantled group are inserted. Inserting in the existing parent is probably the way to go, the insertion index (z-order) remains to be figured out. The only tricky thing will be to ensure we properly handle these operations on a mix of items with and without views, by reinserting views in the most adequate superview.

* Fix stack and unstack operations, they are currently broken. Documentation is probably missing in this area. Stack/Unstack operations are unrelated to the stack layout (we got a naming issue here), they allow to set a temporary layout on an item group, so that the child item becomes visible instead of the drawing or the view of the item group itself. For example, you set a table layout on a folder item, then the content of the folder appears 'exploded' as a table view rather than just an opaque folder icon. This feature gives a very generic implementation of Aperture-like stacks.

* Write code to deal with shift modifier for extending or restricting the selection.

* Check command modifier is correctly handled on adding or removing a single item to the selection.

# Basic Stuff

## Properties 

* Expose more properties for Foundation, AppKit, EtoileFoundation and EtoileUI classes.

* Handle read-only properties in a sane way, usually when no setter is available. A method like -isReadOnlyProperty: (NSString *)propertyName should be added to NSObject+Model in EtoileFoundation; not really sure this is the best method name though. We also need to update CoreObject related classes to use this same mechanism.

* See Refactoring for more properties related stuff.

# Refactoring

* Rename -properties (first declared in NSObject+Model part of EtoileFoundation) to -propertyNames to eliminate collisions with other GNUstep/Cocoa classes

* Patch NSBitmapImageRep to avoid method collision with -valueForProperty:, probably rely on posing a subclass or a category and method swizzling

## Layout

* Rename ETStackLayout to ETColumnLayout

* Modularize ETFlowLayout, ETLineLayout and ETStackLayout in order to:
	- share a common underlying layout algorithm (only flow and line shares code presently)
	- implement a vertical flow algorithm
	- ony request a minimal protocol for layouted objects: -x, -y, -width, -height, -setX:, -setY:, -setWidth:, setHeight: instead of the more complex one needed by a concrete layout that deals with ETLayoutItem instances (and the whole layout item tree machinery that encompass extra stuff like the event handling... for which the layout takes over in some cases).

The inheritance rooted in ETLayout goes currently like that:
	- ETFlowLayout
		- ETLineLayout
	- ETStackLayout

After the refactoring it should be:
	- ETFlowLayout
	- ETLineLayout
	- ETStackLayout

and a separate ETLayoutAlgorithm class tree of layout strategies:
	- ETHorizontalFlowAlgorithm
	- ETVerticalFlowAlgorithm
For these two subclasses, you can specify how the overflow should be handled. In ETFlowLayout, the right Flow algorithm is selected depending on the value returned by -isVerticallyOriented. In a very-long term vision, these classes could be eventually be subclassed for implementing text layout algorithms (see Universal Polygons in STEPS first year report).

So ETLineLayout results of using ETHorizontalFlowAlgorithm limited to a single line and the overflow hidden. Similarly ETStackLayout results of using ETVerticalFlowAlgorithm limited to a single column and the overflow hidden.


# New Features

## Drawing

* Implement rotation support for layout items without view, the code should be put in -[ETLayoutItemGroup render:dirtyRect:inView]

## Layout

* Implement shape-driven and pattern-driven layouts (a typical case is a grid layout)

# New Applications & Examples

## Generalize AZSwitch into a versatile Expose-like application that allows to navigate the windows with any EtoileUI layouts. AZSwitch can be seen as a subcase of such an application that only comes with an hardcoded ETTableLayout.

## Write a System-wide Shelf (also often referenced as Overlay Shelf) that runs in a standalone process. Involves to subclass ETPickboard in the Shelf code and modify +[ETPickboard systemPickboard] to return a DO proxy of the pickboard instance in the Shelf process. If we put aside collaboration features, a first implementation Shelf application should probably be around one hundred lines of code. Most of the code involves to override -insertItem:atIndex: and -removeItem: in the following spirit:

// layout items are received by ref through DO and -pushObject: should pass objects by ref too.
- (void) insertItem: (id)item atIndex: (int)index
{
	BOOL putProxyOnTheShelf = [item isMetaLayoutItem]; // a meta layout item is a UI proxy
	
	if (putProxyOnTheShelf) // picked a link (encompasses the lazy removal case when -shouldRemoveItemAtPickTime: returns NO)
	{
		[super insertItem: item atIndex: index]; // nothing to do in this case
	}
	else // picked an object or an object copy (aka cut and copy)
	{
		// The CoreObject implementation for this code is underway but far
		// from usable... the following is a very rough approach that will need
		// to be carefully refined.
		id modelObject = [item representedObject];

		if ([modelObject isManagedCoreObject] == NO)
			[CoreObject snapshot: [object representedObject] inLibrary: ShelfLibrary];
	
		[super insertItem: item atIndex: index];
	}
}

Then an ETOverlayShelfLayout could be created as an ETFreeLayout subclass to encapsulate the default UI of the Shelf in a pluggable layout.

## Write a PhotoManager


# Long-term Experiments

## AppKit

### Modularize NSView to fully separate all the concerns (event handling, hierarchy/composite, drawing surface, responders)
