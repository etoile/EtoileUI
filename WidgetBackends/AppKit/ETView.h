/** ETView is the generic view class extensively used by EtoileUI and whose 
instance are named 'supervisor view'.

An ETView instance is bound to a layout item or a decorator item unlike NSView 
instances. ETLayoutItem automatically wraps any view you set with -setView: into 
a supervisor view.
	
The supervisor view is a wrapper that allows EtoileUI to intercept the drawing 
process. ETView delegates the drawing to its item in the -render:  method.<br />
More importantly, -render: isn't truly a delegated version of -drawRect:. 
This method makes possible to draw directly over the subviews rather than 
beneath. This drawing path is widely used in EtoileUI.
	
You must not subclass ETView.

Take note that we plan to eliminate ETView and the supervisor view concept in a 
next EtoileUI release. */
