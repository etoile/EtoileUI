### Default Variable Values For Conveniency ###

# You can overidde any variable values defined by below by resetting the value
# in the GNUmakefile.preamble of your module. For example:
# unexport ADDITIONAL_INCLUDE_DIRS = 
# If you don't put 'unexport' in front of the variable name, the variable will
# be reset but still exported to submake instances (this is never the case with
# gnustep-make variables, that's why you must include a GNUmakefile.preamble in
# any subdirectories of your module usually).

# If we have dependency, once it's imported we need to include its headers
# located PROJECT_DIR/PROJECT_NAME. This means we have to look in 
# PROJECT_DIR since we usually use include directive like 
# #import <PROJECT_NAME/header.h>
#
# By default we also look for headers in PROJECT_DIR and PROJECT_DIR/Headers, 
# this conveniency avoids to take care of such flags over and over.

export ADDITIONAL_INCLUDE_DIRS += -I$(BUILD_DIR) -I$(PROJECT_DIR) -I$(PROJECT_DIR)/Headers

# If we have dependency, we need to link its resulting object file. Well, we
# have to look for a library or a framework most of time.
#
# NOTE: We cannot use $(GNUSTEP_SHARED_OBJ) instead of shared_obj because the 
# former variable is relative to the project and could be modified by the 
# developer. For example, it's commonly equals to ./shared_obj

export ADDITIONAL_LIB_DIRS += -L$(BUILD_DIR)

# We disable warnings about #import being deprecated. They occur with old GCC
# version (before 4.0 iirc).
export ADDITIONAL_OBJCFLAGS += -Wno-import

# For test bundles, we must link UnitKit
